# Project Title

This is a very simple and basic Nodejs authentication API. Original project of this project was
made by [guruhariharaun](guruhariharaun/Registration-and-Login-Form-in-Nodejs-and-MongoDB). In the original project,
you can run this with your browser by using the HTML form. But in this project you need POSTMAN to test and run it.
But you can still make your own HTML form by setting the 'routes' and make the views.

## What You Need?

- NODE JS
- MongoDB

## Installation

```bash
  npm i
```

Then run the server with

```bash
  node app

The server will be running on localhost:3000
